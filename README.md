# Do you know this ? 

**A site where you gain experience based on the cultural elements you consume.**

*Do You Know This* is a mix between Letterboxd, MyLudo, GoodReads, and Steam. It allows you to store all the movies, books, and games you've consumed. 

## And more concretly 
*Do You Know This* is a site that offers to rate the cultural elements absorbed, it is possible to date them, rate them, write a comment, specify the genre. The more you watch, read (...), the more you earn XP. A daily quest like "watch a sci-fi movie" allows you to earn even more XP. In addition, there are also badges that you unlock by collecting the same medium several times. For example, the music lover badge is unlocked after having listened to 15 albums.
